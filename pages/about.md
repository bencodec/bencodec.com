# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I'm a Brooklyn-based electronic musician, Ableton Certified Trainer, and overall music tech nerd. I'm a huge fan of Live, Push, Max for Live, as well as a bunch of other inspiring musical tools and use them daily. I teaches Ableton Live to musicians across all genres, from avant-garde to zydeco, locally in NYC and online around the world.
